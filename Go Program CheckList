A personal program checklist. 

## CRUD
1. When create multiple records, handle the case where some records are inserted to storage but others are not due due to certain reasons.
    Solution: 1. Make it a transaction; 2. Return how many records are inserted successfully. 
2. When query records, 
3. When delete a non-existed records, return an err "ErrNoRecord".

## Pointer
1. Always check nil before manipulating on pinters.
